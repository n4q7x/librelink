# LinkedIn's Dark Patterns

The term “dark patterns” was coined by UX designer Harry Brignull in 2010, when he launched the site [darkpatterns.org](https://www.deceptive.design/) to catalogue deceptive interface designs. He later expanded on this concept in his article “Dark Patterns: Deception vs. Honesty in UI Design” (Brignull, 2011, A List Apart, https://alistapart.com/article/dark-patterns-deception-vs-honesty-in-ui-design/). He defined dark patterns as “tricks used in websites and apps that make you do things that you didn’t mean to, like buying or signing up for something” (Brignull, 2010, https://www.deceptive.design/). The term quickly caught hold with UX designers, regulators, and researchers, as more people began to document how major platforms and e-commerce sites used dark patterns such as misleading opt-outs, pre-checked boxes, and confusing subscription or privacy settings.


## Documentation (ie video screen grabs)

- LinkedIn forciy logs you in via Google even aftee you logged out
- LinkedIn uses hostile engagement tactics like puzzle games, news, news feed, people you may know, and tries to force you to post because it apparently increases your chances of getting a job
- LinkedIn dominates the job network space with network effects. There is no good alternative, yet it's awful. This must be rectified.
- LinkedIn does not have transparent control over notifications. Even if you turn off all notifications, they will send you more ones.



# And hopefully, holding people accountable for doing this

- who made these business decisions?
- what legal grounds are there for consequences?

# Other ways to undermine LinkedIn

- boycott
- share information about how poorly they respect user rights
- use alternativr platforms

# LinkedIn's Dark Patterns

The term “dark patterns” was coined by UX designer Harry Brignull in 2010, when he launched the site [darkpatterns.org](https://www.deceptive.design/) to catalogue deceptive interface designs. He later expanded on this concept in his article “Dark Patterns: Deception vs. Honesty in UI Design” (Brignull, 2011, A List Apart, https://alistapart.com/article/dark-patterns-deception-vs-honesty-in-ui-design/). He defined dark patterns as “tricks used in websites and apps that make you do things that you didn’t mean to, like buying or signing up for something” (Brignull, 2010, https://www.deceptive.design/). The term quickly caught hold with UX designers, regulators, and researchers, as more people began to document how major platforms and e-commerce sites used dark patterns such as misleading opt-outs, pre-checked boxes, and confusing subscription or privacy settings.

But dark patterns are arguably much broader than simply being misleading. Any aspect of user interaction design that is malicious can be considered a dark pattern: interfaces which hijack information, try to coerce behavior, a lack of transparent intentions, trying to use users for other ends, not prioritizing user well being including emotional and psychological well being, exploitative tactics to increase spending, and so on.

Of course, the inventors of a whole cadre of modern dark patterns - perhaps the initiator of the very idea of an entire software business model based on dark patterns - was Facebook. Since then, 2 websites we have seen borrow their engagement hacking techniques have especially been Quora and LinkedIn. 



## Documentation (ie video screen grabs)

- LinkedIn forciy logs you in via Google even aftee you logged out
- LinkedIn uses hostile engagement tactics like puzzle games, news, news feed, people you may know, and tries to force you to post because it apparently increases your chances of getting a job
- LinkedIn dominates the job network space with network effects. There is no good alternative, yet it's awful. This must be rectified.
- LinkedIn does not have transparent control over notifications. Even if you turn off all notifications, they will send you more ones.



# And hopefully, holding people accountable for doing this

- who made these business decisions?
- what legal grounds are there for consequences?

# Other ways to undermine LinkedIn

- boycott
- share information about how poorly they respect user rights
- use alternativr platforms
